專案貢獻：
(1) 提升掃描器效能：降低掃描器執行Decode的頻率以提升效能。由於原本的元件在掃描時
，掃描器在Decode的頻率上沒有進行管況，所以當開啟掃描器時，大量的處理掃描器Decode的Request
，若當前的Layout有其它的Button或是Input時
，就會發現有嚴重延遲的狀況。

(2) 增加掃描器的開關按鈕，開發者可以自己絕對這些按鈕是否呈現在前端UI。

Usage
-----

Import this project and android bootstrap project(https://github.com/s9ya76/Android-Bootstrap).

Add the following to your build.gradle:

```java
dependencies {
   compile project(':zxscan')
}
```

Android library for adding barcode scanning functionality into any Android app with ease.

The library uses ZXing core as default decoder engine and our own camera streaming library and is very lightweight, customizable and extremely easy to embed into the application.

Simply include `ScannerView` in your layout XML.

```xml
<eu.livotov.zxscan.ScannerView
    android:id="@+id/scanner"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent" />
```

Add scanned code event receiver.

```java
ScannerView scanner = (ScannerView) findViewById(R.id.scanner);
scanner.setScannerViewEventListener(new ScannerView.ScannerViewEventListener()
{
            public boolean onCodeScanned(final String data)
            {
                scanner.stopScanner();
                Toast.makeText(this, "Data scanned: " + data, Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
                return true;
            }
});
```

Start scanner when you need it.

```java
scanner.startScanner();
```

That't it ! Alternatively you may operate with the ScannerFragment instead. The only difference is that ScannerFragment
starts and stops scanner automatically when fragment is resumed/paused.

See also the simple demo application that is included.


Known Issues
------------

- Currently scanner tries to recognize all supported barcodes. Option to try only specified types will be added shortly.


Getting It
----------

ZXScanLib is available from maven repository:

- Maven repository: *http://maven.livotovlabs.pro/content/groups/public*
- Group name: *eu.livotov.labs*
- Artifact ID: *zxscanlib*

Available versions:

- Latest release version: 2.0.1
- Latest development snapshot: 2.1.1-SNAPSHOT

*Please note that versions 0.9.x and 1.x are from previous generation of this library - they are completely different in api and obsolete.*

Gradle:

```groovy

repositories {
    ...
    maven { url 'http://maven.livotovlabs.pro/content/groups/public' }
    ...
}

compile ('eu.livotov.labs:zxscanlib:2.0.1@aar') {transitive=true}

```

Note, that ZXScanLib depends internally on CAMView project, so ```transitive=true``` statement is required in order to compile.


Tweaking The Scanner
----------------

All configuration is made on ScannerView instance. If you're operating with ScannerFragment, you can get ScannerView instance by
calling ```getScanner()``` method.

- To enable or disable sound beep when the code is scanned, use ```setPlaySound(true|false);```
- To use your own sound for beep, set it using ```setScannerSoundAudioResource(R.raw.my_beep);``` - you can use .wav, .ogg or .mp3 files.
- To show or hide the HUD (red square above the picture from camera), use ```setHudVisible(true|false);```
- To use your own picture of HUD, set it using ```setHudImageResource(R.drawable.my_hud_image);```

If you want complete scanner layout rework, extend ScannerView and override the ```getScannerLayoutResource()``` method in order to
specify your own layout:

```java
public class MyScannerView extends ScannerView
{
    @Override
    protected int getScannerLayoutResource()
    {
        return R.layout.my_customized_scanner_layout;
    }
}
```

Note, that your layout **MUST** contain at least the ```CAMView``` object definition with the special ID ```zxscanlib_camera``` :

```xml
<eu.livotov.labs.android.camview.CAMView
            android:id="@id/zxscanlib_camera"
            android:layout_width="match_parent"
            android:layout_height="match_parent"/>
```



Contributing
------------

We're always happy for external help and any contributions !

- If you want to contribute to barcode scanning/recognition/customization area, please submit a ticket, fork the project, apply changes and submit a pull request.
- If you want to contribute to camera manager, you're welcome to do the same steps as above but for CAMView project: https://github.com/LivotovLabs/CAMView - it is used
internally in ZXScanLib for streaming and capturing live data from the device camera.

Thanks ZXing (https://github.com/zxing/zxing) for the core decoding engine that is used as default processor to decode captured bitmaps !
